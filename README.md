# Connect 4
## This is a Python implementation of the 2-player board game Connect Four using the Pygame module and NumPy. 
### To run the project:
  * Download the project folder.
  * Open Command Prompt if you're on Windows or Terminal for Mac.
  * Make sure your python libraries, particularly numpy and pygame, are installed and up to date
      - For installing use `pip install _____` and for upgrading `pip upgrade _____`
  * Change the current working directory to the directory of the project folder.
  * Run the game using `python connectfour.py`
### Playing the game:
The game starts with the first player's move. You control which row to drop the piece in by moving the mouse over the desired row and clicking. After dropping the piece, the next player makes their move as the first player did, and the game continues so forth. The rules follow the Connect Four board game's rules, with 4 pieces in a row, diagonally, vertically or horizontally in any direction resulting in a player winning. It is possible to tie in the game as in real life. **I hope you have fun and enjoy playing this simple game!**
